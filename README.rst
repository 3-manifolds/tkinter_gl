tkinter_gl
==========

This Python package provides the tkinter widget class GLCanvas which
can serve as a rendering surface for an OpenGL client.

The responsibility of this class is only to manage an OpenGL context.

Clients need some other library such as PyOpenGL to make the OpenGL
calls from python.
